Booting x86_64 images on Qemu
-----------------------------

A. What is needed?
   It is required that you have a machine with grub2. Any
   latest Linux distro should have it. Compiling and installing
   grub2 is out of scope for this document. It is also
   required that you are running a 64-bit Linux because
   cross compiling for 64-bit on 32-bit machines is not
   discussed here.

B. Steps to build a bootable image of Xvisor
   1. Clone xvisor-x86_64 repo
          git clone git://github.com/hschauhan/xvisor-x86_64.git

   2. Build Xvisor with following command:
           make ARCH=x86 x86_64_generic-defconfig
           make
   3. Create a directory xvisor-iso _somewhere_.
           mkdir -p xvisor-iso/boot/grub

   4. Copy the xvisor image in the ISO directory:
           cp XVISOR_BASE/build/vmm.bin xvisor-iso/boot/
       where XVISOR_BASE is base directory where you pulled
       the xvisor tree.

   5. Create a grub configuration file under ISO directory
         <your editor> xvisor-iso/boot/grub/grub.cfg
         CUT AND PASTE FOLLOWING IN IT
         -------8<----CUT-START--8<---------------
             set timeout=15
             set default=0

             menuentry "Xvisor x86_64" {
                  multiboot /boot/vmm.bin
                  boot
             }
         -------8<----CUT-END----8<---------------
         Please copy paste above. A slight mistake won't
         boot your system.

   6. Create a ISO to boot
          grub-mkrescue -o bootable.iso xvisor-iso/

   7. Boot the image
          qemu-system-x86_64 -boot d -cdrom bootable.iso
