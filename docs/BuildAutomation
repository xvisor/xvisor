                Xvisor build automation.

About verifying you didn't break the Xvisor build.
==================================================

When you add some changes to Xvisor you need to verify that the proposed
change, that you may have intended for a single platform, does not break
the build for one or several of the Xvisor supported platform/defconfig.

To help you with this there is a shell script in tools/scripts/makeall that
will build Xvisor for all supported defconfig file and all supported arch.
As Xvisor build requires some cross-compilers for most supported archs, the
script will automatically try to find some available cross-compilers in
your build environment. Depending on the availability of such cross-compilers
in your environment the script will tell you if it managed to build Xvisor
for all supported defconfigs.

Now it might feel tedious to run the "makeall" shell script by hand just to
verify you didn't break anything and you might not have all the required
cross-compiler installed on your build system. Luckily, this step can be
automated by using the freely available "travis CI" service. With "travis CI"
you will be able to automatically build Xvisor on top of a standardized
environment for all supported arch and defconfig.

Once you have setup your "travis CI" account with your Xvisor github
repository, any "git push" you make on one of the branch of your github
repository will trigger a build in "travis CI". The failure or success of
the build will be notified to you through email.

How to setup your "travis CI" automated build.
==============================================

First you need to sign in into "travis CI". 

	https://travis-ci.org/

You could create a specific account but it is recommended to sign in with
your gitbub account. This way all you github repositories will be available
inside "travis CI"

Then you need to add a repository to your "travis CI" dashboard. So add a
repository and select your github xvisor repository.

Once your Xvisor repository is added you can cutomize its "settings". In
particular you can can activate the 2 following options:
	- Build only if .travis.yml is present
	- Build pushes

The next step is to add a .travis.yml file to your Xvisor repository. You
can add this file to your master branch but if you want to stay in sync with
the upstream Xvisor repository this might not be the best choice.

So this .travis.yml file is to be added into your working branches. You need
to commit a .travis.yml file into the base directory of your Xvisor
repository inside your working branch. The typical content of the .travis.yml
file is as follow:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
dist: trusty

language: c

compiler:
  - gcc

script: tools/scripts/makeall

before_install:
  - sudo add-apt-repository ppa:team-gcc-arm-embedded/ppa -y
  - sudo apt-get -q update
  - sudo apt-get install -y gcc-arm-embedded
  - sudo apt-get install -y gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu

notifications:
  email:
    on_success: always
    on_failure: always
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once you push the commit with this file to your working branch, "travis CI"
will build Xvisor for all arch and defconfigs and will notify you of
success/failure through email. Any subsequent "git push" on this branch will
also trigger a build on "travis CI".
