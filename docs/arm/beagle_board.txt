		Xvisor on QEMU Beagleboard using Nand Image 

This readme explains how to build & run Xvisor from nand-flash on beagle board
emulated by QEMU 0.15.xx or higher. 

We need to have 4 images to create the nand-flash image:
 a) x-loader for OMAP3  (2nd stage bootloader for OMAP3)
 b) u-boot binary for OMAP3  (3rd stage bootloader)
 c) x-visor binary (vmm.bin)
 d) patched guest binary (in our case realview pb-a8 test image, arm_test.bin.patched)

Following steps will help you create these images and then boot Xvisor on Beagleboard QEMU:

  [1. Build environment]
  # CROSS_COMPILE=arm-none-linux-gnueabi-

  (Follow step 2 to get the prebuilt x-loader and u-boot binaries, or 
   steps 3-4 to build those images from source)
  
  [2. Download X-loader and u-boot binary]
  # wget http://qemu-omap3.googlecode.com/files/image-v0.01.tar.bz2
  # mkdir prebuilt-images/
  # tar -xvjf image-v0.01.tar.bz2 -C prebuilt-images/

  (we would not need the uImage extracted in the above step)

  [3. Download and build X-loader from source - this creates x-load.bin.ift]
  # git clone git://gitorious.org/x-load-omap3/mainline.git
  # cd mainline
  # make omap3530beagle_config
  # make x-load.bin.ift
  # cd ..

  [4. Download and build u-boot from source - this creates u-boot.bin]
  # git clone git://git.denx.de/u-boot.git
  # cd u-boot
  # make omap3_beagle_config
  # make omap3_beagle
  # cd ..

  [5. GoTo Xvisor source directory]
  # cd <xvisor_source_directory>

  [6. Configure Xvisor with Beagleboard host default settings]
  # make ARCH=arm beagle-defconfig 

  [7. Build Xvisor, this creates vmm.bin]
  # make

  [8. Build ARM Basic Test for Realview PB-A8 Guest, this creates arm_test.bin.patched]
  # make -C tests/armv7a/pb-a8/basic
  
  [9. Copy the x-loader and u-boot binaries (from step 2 or 3-4) into Xvisor build-directory]
  # cp <path-to-x-loader-binary>/x-load.bin.ift <path-to-u-boot-binary>/u-boot.bin build/

  [10. Create a flat binary with all our binaries appended]
  # ./tools/scripts/memimg.py -a 0 -o build/beagle.img build/x-load.bin.ift@0x0 build/u-boot.bin@0x80000 build/vmm.bin@0x280000 build/tests/armv7a/pb-a8/basic/arm_test.bin.patched@0x680000

  [11. Build the beagleboard nand-flash image from the flat binary created]
  # ./tools/nandflash/bb_nandflash.sh build/beagle.img build/beagle-nand.bin ./build/tools/nandflash/bb_nandflash_ecc 

  [12. Launch QEMU 0.15.xx higher ]
  # qemu-system-arm -M beagle -drive file=build/beagle-nand.bin,if=mtd -display none -serial stdio -s

  [13. Copy Xvisor from nand-flash to DRAM]
  OMAP3 beagleboard.org # nand read 0x80008000 0x280000 0x100000

  [14. Copy Guest image from nand-flash to DRAM]
  OMAP3 beagleboard.org # nand read 0x80800000 0x680000 0x100000

  [15. Jump into Xvisor]
  OMAP3 beagleboard.org # go 0x80008000

  [16. Kick Guest for starting Basic Test]
  XVisor# guest kick 0

  [17. Bind to virtual UART]
  XVisor# vserial bind guest0/uart0

  [18. Say 'hi' to ARM Basic Test]
  [guest0/uart0] arm-test# hi

  [19. Say 'hello' to ARM Basic Test]
  [guest0/uart0] arm-test# hello

  [20. Check various commands of ARM Basic Test]
  [guest0/uart0] arm-test# help

  [21. Enter character seqence 'ESCAPE+x+q" return to Xvisor prompt]
  [guest0/uart0] arm-test# 

  (Note: replace all <> brackets based on your workspace)
