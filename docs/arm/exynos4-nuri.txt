		Xvisor on Linaro QEMU NURI Host

This section of readme explains how to build & run Xvisor for NURI 
emulated by QEMU. 

By default, Xvisor for NURI supports Realview-PB-A8 guest so we will
show how to run Basic Firmware on Realview-PB-A8 guest. For more info
refer, <xvisor_source>/tests/arm32/realview-pb-a8/basic/README.

Please follow the steps below to build & run Basic Firmware on Realview-PB-A8 
guest with Xvisor running on QEMU NURI Host:

  [1. Build environment for Xvisor]
  # CROSS_COMPILE=arm-none-linux-gnueabi-

  [2. GoTo Xvisor source directory]
  # cd <xvisor_source_directory>

  [3. Configure Xvisor with NURI default settings]
  # make ARCH=arm exynos4210-nuri-defconfig

  [4. Build Xvisor]
  # make

  [5. Build Basic Firmware]
  # make -C tests/arm32/realview-pb-a8/basic

  [6. Create qemu.img for running it on QEMU]
  # ./tools/scripts/memimg.py -a 0x40010000 -o build/qemu.img build/vmm.bin@0x40010000 build/tests/arm32/realview-pb-a8/basic/firmware.bin.patched@0x41000000

  [7. Launch QEMU]
  # qemu-system-arm -M nuri -m 256M -display none -serial stdio -kernel build/qemu.img

  [8. Kick Guest0 for starting Basic Firmware]
  XVisor# guest kick guest0

  [9. Bind to virtual UART]
  XVisor# vserial bind guest0/uart0

  [10. Say 'hi' to Basic Firmware]
  [guest0/uart0] basic# hi

  [11. Say 'hello' to Basic Firmware]
  [guest0/uart0] basic# hello

  [12. Check various commands of Basic Firmware]
  [guest0/uart0] basic# help

  [13. Enter character seqence 'ESCAPE+x+q" return to Xvisor prompt]
  [guest0/uart0] basic#
