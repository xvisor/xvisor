	Xvisor on Raspberry-Pi (or BCM2835 SOC) using SD Booting 

This section of readme explains how to build & run Xvisor on actual 
Raspberry Pi board using SD booting feature of Raspberry Pi (or BCM2835 SOC).

By default, Xvisor for BCM2835 supports Realview-EB-MPCore guest so we will 
show how to run Basic Firmware (and/or Linux) on Realview-EB-MPCore guest.

As first step of SD booting on BCM2835 SOC, we prepare a SD card (> 4GB) with
Uboot. To do this,
 1) Setup SD card with debian weezy image and make sure that you get
    Raspberry Pi linux console on serial port
    (For detailed steps, http://elinux.org/RPi_Easy_SD_Card_Setup)
 2) Now compile and install u-boot on SD card for Raspberry Pi so that you get
    u-boot prompt whenever you power-on Raspberry Pi
    (For detailed steps, http://elinux.org/RPi_U-Boot)

Once we have SD card prepared for SD booting with u-boot, we add 2 images to
the boot partition of SD card:
 1) U-Boot compatible Xvisor binary (uvmm.bin).
 2) Disk image containing guest binaries (disk.img).

Following are steps to create these images and boot Xvisor on Raspberry Pi:

  [1. Build environment for Xvisor]
  # export CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabi-

  [2. GoTo Xvisor source directory]
  # cd <xvisor_source_directory>

  [3. Configure Xvisor with Generic v6 default settings]
  # make ARCH=arm generic-v6-defconfig

  [4. Build Xvisor & DTBs]
  # make; make dtbs

  [5. Make U-Boot compatible uvmm.bin for use with bootm command]
  # mkimage -A arm -O linux -T kernel -C none -a 0x00008000 -e 0x00008000 -n Xvisor -d build/vmm.bin build/uvmm.bin

  [6. Build Basic Firmware]
  # make -C tests/arm32/realview-eb-mpcore/basic

  [7. Copy defconfig to Linux build directory]
  # cp tests/arm32/realview-eb-mpcore/linux/linux-<linux_version>_defconfig <linux_build_directory>/.config

  [8. GoTo Linux source directory]
  # cd <linux_source_directory>

  [9. Configure Linux in build directory]
  # make O=<linux_build_directory> ARCH=arm oldconfig

  [10. Build Linux in build directory]
  # make O=<linux_build_directory> ARCH=arm Image

  [11. Patch Linux kernel to replace sensitive non-priviledged instructions]
  # <xvisor_source_directory>/arch/arm/cpu/arm32/elf2cpatch.py -f <linux_build_directory>/vmlinux | <xvisor_source_directory>/build/tools/cpatch/cpatch32 <linux_build_directory>/vmlinux 0

  [12. Build Linux in build directory to reflect changes in kernel image]
  # make O=<linux_build_directory> ARCH=arm Image

  [13. Create BusyBox RAMDISK to be used as RootFS for Linux kernel]
  (Note: For subsequent steps, we will assume that your RAMDISK is located at <busybox_rootfs_directory>/rootfs.img)
  (Note: Please refer tests/common/busybox/README.md for creating rootfs.img using BusyBox)

  [14. GoTo Xvisor source directory]
  # cd <xvisor_source_directory>

  [15. Create disk image for Xvisor with Guest Linux and Guest Basic Firmware]
  # mkdir -p ./build/disk/tmp
  # mkdir -p ./build/disk/system

  # genext2fs -B 1024 -b 16384 -d ./build/disk ./build/disk.img

  [16. Make U-boot compatible initrd for use with bootm command]
  # mkimage -A arm -O linux -T ramdisk -a 0x01000000 -n "Xvisor ramdisk" -d build/disk.img build/udisk.img

  [17. Unplug bootable SD card from Raspberry Pi and plug it on your development machine]

  [18. Mount boot partition (or partition 0) of SD card on your development machine]

  [19. Copy uvmm.bin, DTB, and disk.im to boot partition of SD card]

  (Note: replace all <> brackets based on your workspace)
  (Note: some of the above steps will need to be adapted for other
   types of ARM host)
  (Note: for more info on your desired ARM host refer docs/arm/)
  (Note: you are free to change the ordering of above steps based
   on your workspace)
