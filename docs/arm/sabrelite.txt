	Xvisor on Sabre LITE (or Nitrogen6X) using SD Booting

This section of readme explains how to build & run Xvisor on real hardware
Sabre LITE using SD booting feature Boundary Devices preconfigured U-Boot.
Ensure the SD is formatted with a Xvisor recognized filesystem (CPIO, Ext4, or
FAT).

We need to add 2 images in boot partition of SD card that is shipped with
Sabre LITE:
 1) U-Boot compatible Xvisor binary (uvmm.bin).
 2) Boot script used by Boundary's U-Boot configuration (6x_bootscript)

Following steps to create these images and then boot Xvisor on Sabre LITE:

  [1. Build environment]
  # CROSS_COMPILE=arm-unknown-linux-gnueabi-
  # export CROSS_COMPILE
  (NOTE: Also place your compiler in PATH.)

  [2. GoTo Xvisor source directory]
  # cd <xvisor_source_directory>

  [3. Configure Xvisor with Sabre LITE (or Nitrogen6X) host default settings]
  # make ARCH=arm imx6-defconfig

  [4. Build Xvisor and DTBs]
  # make; make dtbs

  [5. Build Basic Firmware]
  # make -C tests/arm32/sabrelite-a9/basic

  [6. Make U-Boot compatible uvmm.bin for use with bootm command]
  # mkimage -A arm -O linux -T kernel -C none -a 0x17800000 -e 0x17800000 -n Xvisor -d build/vmm.bin build/uvmm.bin

  [7. Make the script to boot the card as preconfigured U-Boot expect]
  # mkimage -A arm -O linux -T script -C none -a 0 -e 0 -n "boot script" -d docs/arm/sabrelite-bootscript build/6x_bootscript

  [8. Create the guest device tree configuration]
  # ./build/tools/dtc/dtc -I dts -O dtb ./tests/arm32/sabrelite-a9/sabrelite-a9.dts -o build/sabrelite-a9.dtb

  [9. Unplug SD card from Sabre LITE and plug it on your development machine]

  [10. Mount boot partition (or partition 0) of SD card on your development machine]

  [11. Copy uvmm.bin to boot partition of SD card]
  # cp -f build/uvmm.bin <path_to_mounted_boot_partition_of_sd_card>

  [12. Copy and rename the host and guest device tree to boot partition of SD card]
  # cp -f build/arch/arm/board/generic/dts/imx6/sabrelite-a9/one_guest_sabrelite-a9.dtb <path_to_mounted_boot_partition_of_sd_card>/vmm-imx6q-sabrelite.dtb
  # cp -f build/sabrelite-a9.dtb <path_to_mounted_boot_partition_of_sd_card>/

  [13. Copy the basic firmware, the nor_flash.list and the cmdlist on the SD card boot partition]
  # cp -f build/tests/arm32/sabrelite-a9/basic/firmware.bin.patched <path_to_mounted_boot_partition_of_sd_card>/
  # cp -f tests/arm32/sabrelite-a9/linux/nor_flash.list <path_to_mounted_boot_partition_of_sd_card>/
  # cp -f tests/arm32/sabrelite-a9/linux/cmdlist <path_to_mounted_boot_partition_of_sd_card>/

  [14. Configure, build and patch the kernel image]
  # cd <linux_source_directory>
  # cp -f <xvisor_source_directory>/tests/arm32/sabrelite-a9/linux/linux-<kernel_version>_sabrelite_a9_defconfig .config
  # make O=<linux_build_directory> ARCH=arm oldconfig
  # make O=<linux_build_directory> ARCH=arm Image
  # <xvisor_source_directory>/arch/arm/cpu/arm32/elf2cpatch.py -f <linux_build_directory>/vmlinux | <xvisor_source_directory>/build/tools/cpatch/cpatch32 <linux_build_directory>/vmlinux 0
  # make O=<linux_build_directory> ARCH=arm Image
  # cd <xvisor_source_directory>

  [15. Build, if not already done, the Linux kernel device tree]
  # ./build/tools/dtc/dtc -I dts -O dtb <kernel path>/arch/arm/boot/dts/vexpress-v2p-ca9.dts -o build/vexpress-v2p-ca9.dtb

  [16. Copy the _patched_ kernel image, and its device tree to the SD card boot partition]
  # cp -f <linux_build_directory>/arch/arm/boot/Image <path_to_mounted_boot_partition_of_sd_card>/
  # cp -f build/vexpress-v2p-ca9.dtb <path_to_mounted_boot_partition_of_sd_card>/

  [12. Copy the boot script to boot partition of SD card]
  # cp -f build/6x_bootscript <path_to_mounted_boot_partition_of_sd_card>/

  [13. Unmount boot partition (or partition 0) of SD card from your development machine]

  [14. Unplug SD card from your development machine and plug it back on Sabre LITE]

  [15. Connect to serial port of Sabre LITE using Putty or Minicom]

  [16. Power-up or Reset Sabre LITE]

  [17. Bind to virtual UART0 of Linux Guest]
  XVisor# vserial bind guest0/uart0

  [18. Start linux booting from RAM]
  [guest0/uart0] basic# autoexec

  (Note: replace all <> brackets based on your workspace)
