	Xvisor on Sabre LITE (or Nitrogen6X) using SD Booting

This section of readme explains how to build & run Xvisor on real hardware
Sabre LITE using SD booting feature Boundary Devices preconfigured U-Boot.
Ensure the SD is formatted with a Xvisor recognized filesystem (CPIO, Ext4,
or FAT).

We need to add 2 images in boot partition of SD card that is shipped with
Sabre LITE:
 1) U-Boot compatible Xvisor binary (uvmm.bin).
 2) Boot script used by Boundary's U-Boot configuration (6x_bootscript)

Follow the following steps to create these images and then boot Xvisor on Sabre LITE:

  [1. Build environment]
  # CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabi-
  # export CROSS_COMPILE
  (NOTE: Also place your compiler in PATH.)
  (NOTE: arm-linux-gnueabi- is here assumed as being the toolchain. It
         is not necessarily the case.)

  [2. Go to Xvisor source directory]
  # cd <xvisor_source_directory>

  [3. Configure Xvisor with Sabre LITE (or Nitrogen6X) host default settings]
  # make ARCH=arm imx6-defconfig

  [4. Build Xvisor and DTBs]
  # make; make dtbs

  [5. Build Basic Firmware]
  # make -C tests/arm32/sabrelite/basic

  [6. Make U-Boot compatible uvmm.bin for use with bootm command]
  # mkimage -A arm -O linux -T kernel -C none -a 0x17800000 -e 0x17800000 -n Xvisor -d build/vmm.bin build/uvmm.bin

  [7. Make the script to boot the card as preconfigured U-Boot expect]
  # mkimage -A arm -O linux -T script -C none -a 0 -e 0 -n "boot script" -d docs/arm/imx6-sabrelite-bootscript build/6x_bootscript

  [8. Create the guest device tree configuration]
  # ./build/tools/dtc/bin/dtc -I dts -O dtb ./tests/arm32/sabrelite/sabrelite.dts -o build/sabrelite.dtb

  [9. Unplug SD card from Sabre LITE and plug it on your development machine]

  [10. Mount boot partition (or partition 0) of SD card on your development machine]

  [11. Copy uvmm.bin to boot partition of SD card]
  # cp -f build/uvmm.bin <path_to_mounted_boot_partition_of_sd_card>

  [12. Create the tree structure in your SD card]
  # mkdir -p <path_to_mounted_boot_partition_of_sd_card>/images/arm32/sabrelite/
  # mkdir -p <path_to_mounted_boot_partition_of_sd_card>/system/

  [12. Copy and rename the host and guest device tree to boot partition of SD card. <board_name> being sabrelite or nitrogen6x]
  # cp -f build/arch/arm/board/generic/dts/imx6/sabrelite/one_guest_sabrelite.dtb <path_to_mounted_boot_partition_of_sd_card>/vmm-imx6q-<board_name>.dtb
  # cp -f build/sabrelite.dtb <path_to_mounted_boot_partition_of_sd_card>/images/arm32/

  [13. Copy the basic firmware, the nor_flash.list and the cmdlist on the SD card boot partition]
  # cp -f build/tests/arm32/sabrelite/basic/firmware.bin <path_to_mounted_boot_partition_of_sd_card>/images/arm32/sabrelite
  # cp -f tests/arm32/sabrelite/linux/nor_flash.list <path_to_mounted_boot_partition_of_sd_card>/images/arm32/sabrelite
  # cp -f tests/arm32/sabrelite/linux/cmdlist <path_to_mounted_boot_partition_of_sd_card>/images/arm32/sabrelite

  [14. Configure, build and patch the kernel image (linux 4.5.0 is advised)]
  # cd <linux_source_directory>
  # cp -f <xvisor_source_directory>/tests/arm32/sabrelite/linux/linux-<kernel_version>_defconfig <linux_build_directory>/.config
  # sed -i 's/0xff800000UL/0xff000000UL/' arch/arm/include/asm/pgtable.h
  # make O=<linux_build_directory> ARCH=arm oldconfig
  # make O=<linux_build_directory> ARCH=arm Image dtbs
  # <xvisor_source_directory>/arch/arm/cpu/arm32/elf2cpatch.py -f <linux_build_directory>/vmlinux | <xvisor_source_directory>/build/tools/cpatch/cpatch32 <linux_build_directory>/vmlinux 0
  # ${CROSS_COMPILE}objcopy -O binary <linux_build_directory>/vmlinux <linux_build_directory>/arch/arm/boot/Image
  # cd <xvisor_source_directory>

  [15. Then, make cpp process the Linux kernel device tree]
  # sed -re 's|/include/|#include|' tests/arm32/sabrelite/linux/imx6q-nitrogen6x.dts > build/tmp.dts
  # ${CROSS_COMPILE}cpp \
	-nostdinc -nostdlib -fno-builtin -D__DTS__ -x assembler-with-cpp \
	-Itests/arm32/sabrelite/linux \
	-I<linux_source_directory>/include \
	-I<linux_source_directory>/arch/arm/boot/dts \
	build/tmp.dts -o build/imx6q-nitrogen6x.dts

  [16. Build the Linux kernel device tree]
  # ./build/tools/dtc/bin/dtc -I dts -O dtb -p 0x800 build/imx6q-nitrogen6x.dts -o build/imx6q-nitrogen6x.dtb

  [17. Copy the _patched_ kernel image, and its device tree to the SD card boot partition]
  # cp -f <linux_build_directory>/arch/arm/boot/Image <path_to_mounted_boot_partition_of_sd_card>/images/arm32/sabrelite/Image
  # cp -f build/imx6q-nitrogen6x.dtb <path_to_mounted_boot_partition_of_sd_card>/images/arm32/sabrelite

  [18. Copy the boot script to boot partition of SD card]
  # cp -f build/6x_bootscript <path_to_mounted_boot_partition_of_sd_card>/

  [19. Create the banner]
  # cp -f docs/banner/roman.txt <path_to_mounted_boot_partition_of_sd_card>/system/banner.txt

  [20. Generate the rootfs]
  You need to refer to tests/common/busybox/README.md to see how to generate rootfs.img
  using BusyBox.
  # cp -f <busybox_rootfs_directory>/rootfs.img <path_to_mounted_boot_partition_of_sd_card>/images/arm32/rootfs.img

  [20. Unmount boot partition (or partition 0) of SD card from your development machine]

  [21. Unplug SD card from your development machine and plug it back on Sabre LITE]

  [22. Connect to serial port of Sabre LITE using Putty or Minicom]

  [23. Power-up or Reset Sabre LITE]

  [24. When U-Boot starts, stop its autoboot and set the board name]
  U-Boot > setenv board sabrelite
  [Or]
  U-Boot > setenv board nitrogen6x

  [25. Now, you can finally run the bootscript]
  U-Boot > for disk in 0 1 ; do mmc dev ${disk} ; for fs in fat ext2 ; do if ${fs}load mmc ${disk}:1 10008000 /6x_bootscript; then source 10008000; fi ; done ; done

  [26. Kick a guest]
  XVisor# guest kick guest0

  [27. Bind to virtual UART0 of Linux Guest]
  XVisor# vserial bind guest0/uart0

  [28. Start linux booting from RAM]
  [guest0/uart0] basic# autoexec

  (Note: replace all <> brackets based on your workspace)



		Xvisor on QEMU Sabre LITE Host

This section of readme explains how to build & run Xvisor for Sabre LITE
emulated by QEMU.

Xvisor for Sabre LITE supports Realview-PB-A8, Vexpress-A9 and Sabrelite
guest types. In this section, we will show how to run Basic Firmware on
Vexpress-A9 guest. For more info refer,
<xvisor_source>/tests/arm32/vexpress-a9/basic/README.

Please follow the steps below to build & run Basic Firmware on Vexpress-A9
guest with Xvisor running on QEMU Sabre LITE Host:

  [1. Build environment for Xvisor]
  # export CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabi-

  [11. Extract patched Linux kernel image]
  # ${CROSS_COMPILE}objcopy -O binary <linux_build_directory>/vmlinux <linux_build_directory>/arch/arm/boot/Image

  [12. Create BusyBox RAMDISK to be used as RootFS for Linux kernel]
  (Note: For subsequent steps, we will assume that your RAMDISK is located at <busybox_rootfs_directory>/rootfs.img)
  (Note: Please refer tests/common/busybox/README.md for creating rootfs.img using BusyBox)

  [13. GoTo Xvisor source directory]
  # cd <xvisor_source_directory>

  # genext2fs -B 1024 -b 16384 -d ./build/disk ./build/disk.img
  OR
  [14. Create disk image for Xvisor with only Guest Basic Firmware]
  # mkdir -p ./build/disk/tmp
  # mkdir -p ./build/disk/system
  # cp -f ./docs/banner/roman.txt ./build/disk/system/banner.txt
  # cp -f ./docs/logo/xvisor_logo_name.ppm ./build/disk/system/logo.ppm

  # cp -f ./build/tests/arm32/vexpress-a9/basic/firmware.bin.patched ./build/disk/images/arm32/vexpress-a9/firmware.bin
  # cp -f ./tests/arm32/vexpress-a9/basic/nor_flash.list ./build/disk/images/arm32/vexpress-a9/nor_flash.list
  # genext2fs -B 1024 -b 16384 -d ./build/disk ./build/disk.img

  [15. Launch QEMU]
  # qemu-system-arm -M sabrelite -m 512M -display none -serial null -serial stdio -kernel build/vmm.bin -dtb build/arch/arm/board/generic/dts/imx6/sabrelite/one_guest_vexpress-a9.dtb -initrd build/disk.img

  [16. Kick Guest0 for starting Basic Firmware]
  XVisor# guest kick guest0

  [17. Bind to virtual UART0 of Linux Guest]
  XVisor# vserial bind guest0/uart0

  [18. Try few commands of Basic firmware or goto next step]
  [guest0/uart0] basic# hi
  [guest0/uart0] basic# hello
  [guest0/uart0] basic# help

  [19. Copy linux from NOR flash to RAM and start linux booting from RAM]
  [guest0/uart0] basic# autoexec
  (Note: "autoexec" is a short-cut command)
  (Note: The <xvisor_source_directory>/tests/arm32/vexpress-a9/linux/cmdlist file
   which we have added to guest NOR flash contains set of commands for booting
   linux from NOR flash)

  [20. Wait for Linux prompt to come-up and then try out some commands]
  [guest0/uart0] / # ls

  [21. Enter character seqence 'ESCAPE+x+q" return to Xvisor prompt]
  [guest0/uart0] / #

  (Note: replace all <> brackets based on your workspace)
