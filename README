		Xvisor release 0.1.xx <http://www.gnu.org/>

These are the release notes for Xvisor version 0.1. Please read them 
carefully, as they tell you what this is all about, explain how to 
build and use the hypervisor, and what to do if something goes wrong.

WHAT IS XVISOR?

  The term Xvisor can stand for: "eXtensible Versatile hypervISOR".

  Xvisor aims towards providing an open source virtualization solution,
  which is light-weight, portable, and flexible. It tries to ensure 
  small memory foot print and less virtualization overhead in every 
  functionality. Open source projects such as: Linux, NetBSD, FreeBSD,
  and QEMU have made a great impact in Xvisor design & development.

  Xvisor has most of the features expected from a modern fully-fledged 
  hypervisor, such as:
	- CPU virtualization (Guest, Virtual CPUs, Virtual IRQs)
	- MMU virtualization (Virtual MMU, Guest Address Space)
	- IO virtualization (Virtual Bus, Virtual Devices)
	- Device Driver Framework (Host Drivers)
	- Threading Framework (Hyperthreads)
	- Managment Terminal (Mterm)
	- Tree based Configuration (Device Tree)

  It is distributed under the GNU General Public License - see the
  accompanying COPYING file for more details.

ON WHAT HARDWARE DOES IT RUN?

  Xvisor is a highly portable source code. In fact, its development was
  initiated in 2 different architectures (ARM and MIPS) simultaneously,
  to ensure flexiblity and portablity from the begining itself. It is 
  easily portable to most general-purpose 32- or 64-bit architectures as
  long as they have a paged memory management unit (PMMU) and a port of
  the GNU C compiler (gcc) (part of The GNU Compiler Collection, GCC).

  The list of currently supported hardware is below:
	- ARM
		CPUs:   Cortex-A8, OMAP3
		Boards: Realview-PB-A8, Beagle
	- MIPS
		CPUs:   24K
		Boards: QEMU-MIPS

  NOTE: The Xvisor development & testing is done currently on QEMU. For 
	all the above mentioned hardwares QEMU support is available.

INITIATORS:

  - Anup Patel (Aka - Ravan)
  - Himanshu Chauhan (Aka - Gadadhari Bhim)
  - Sukanto Ghosh (Aka - Sukki)

  - Inderpal Saluja (Aka - Inderpal)

DOCUMENTATION:

  There are various README files in the docs/ subdirectory:
  these typically contain hypervisor-specific installation notes for some 
  drivers for example. See docs/INDEX for a list of what is contained in 
  each file.

OUTPUT DIRECTORY:

  When compiling/configuring hypervisor all output files will by default be
  stored in a directory called "build" in hypervisor source directory. Using
  the option "make O=<output_dir>" allow you to specify an alternate place
  for the output files (including .config).

  NOTE: If the 'O=<output_dir>' option is to be used then it must be used for 
  all invocations of make.

CONFIGURING:

  Do not skip this step even if you are only upgrading one minor
  version. New configuration options are added in each release, and
  odd problems will turn up if the configuration files are not set up
  as expected. If you want to carry your existing configuration to a
  new version with minimal work, use "make oldconfig", which will
  only ask you for the answers to new questions.

  To configure hypervisor use one the following command:
	"make <configuration_command>"
		or
	"make O=<output_dir> <configuration_command>"

  Various configuration commands (<configuration_command>) are:
	"config"      Plain text interface.
	"menuconfig"  Text based color menus, radiolists & dialogs.
	"oldconfig"   Default all questions based on the contents of
			your existing ./.config file and asking about
			new config symbols.
	"defconfig"   Create a ./.config file by using the default
			values from arch/$ARCH/board/$BOARD/defconfig.

  For configuration Xvisor uses Openconf, which is a modified version of 
  Linux Kconfig. The motivation behing Openconf is to get Xvisor specific 
  information from environment variables, and to later extend the syntax of
  Kconfig to check for dependent libraries & tools at configuration time. 

  For information on Openconf syntax read: tools/openconf/openconf_syntax.txt

COMPILING:

  Make sure you have at least gcc 4.x available.

  To compile hypervisor use one the following command:
	"make"
	  or
	"make O=<output_dir>"

  Verbose compile/build output:
	Normally the hypervisor build system runs in a fairly quiet mode 
	(but not totally silent).  However, sometimes you or other hypervisor 
	developers need to see compile, link, or other commands exactly as 
	they are executed. For this, use "verbose" build mode.  This is done
	by inserting "VERBOSE=y" in the "make" command.
	E.g.: "make VERBOSE=y"

REMEMBER:

  Its all JUST FOR FUN....
