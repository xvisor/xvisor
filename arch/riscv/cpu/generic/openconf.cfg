	   Adds "C" to the ISA subsets that the toolchain is allowed to emit
	   when building Linux, which results in compressed instructions in the
	   Linux binary.

	   If you don't know what to do here, say Y.

	default y
	help
		This option forces RISC-V compiler to use frame pointer for
		all functions hence making stack tracing possible.

		Enabling this option forces compiler to add additional
		instructions to setup stack frame in function prolog of
		all functions.

		Disabling this option makes hypervisor slightly faster but
		disable stack trace information printed by hypervisor.

		By default, this options is always enabled. You can disable
		this option in-case you want slightly faster and slight
		smaller hypervisor
