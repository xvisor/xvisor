		Linux compatible clock lookup API

config CONFIG_COMMON_CLK
	bool "Common clocking framework"
	select CONFIG_CLKDEV_LOOKUP
	help
	  The common clock framework is a single definition of struct clk
	  useful across many platforms, as well as an implementation of
	  the clock API in drv/clk.h. Architectures utilizing the common
