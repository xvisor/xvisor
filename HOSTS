		Supported Host Hardware

Note: This list is meant to remain in alphabetical order. Please add new 
machines or boards in alphabetical order so that it is much easier to find
and edit them later. It is formatted to allow easy grepping and beautification
by scripts. The fields are: Host Machine Name (M), Host Architecture (A), 
Host CPU Name (C), Host CPU Vendor (V), Emulator for Host Machine (E),
Guest support (G), Current status (S), and Relevant documentation files (D).
If a field spans multiple lines then simply add field prefix to every line.
