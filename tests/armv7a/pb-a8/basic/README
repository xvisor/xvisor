		Basic Test on Realview PB-A8 Guest

The basic test code currently sets up PIC, Timer, and UART and emulates
a dummy terminal which reponds to various commands. It also includes an
extensive MMU test suite and dhrystone benchmark.

Hardware features tested by Basic Test:
  - Sensitive non-priviledged instructions
  - Virtual IRQs
  - Generic Interrupt Controller (GIC)
  - PrimeCell Dual-Mode Timer (SP804)
  - Serial Port (PL011)  

Please follow the steps below to build & run Basic Test on Realview PB-A8:

  [1. Build environment for Xvisor]
  # CROSS_COMPILE=arm-none-linux-gnueabi-

  [2. GoTo Xvisor source directory]
  # cd <xvisor_source_directory>

  [3. Configure Xvisor with Realview PB-A8 default settings]
  # make ARCH=arm pb-a8-defconfig 

  [4. Build Xvisor]
  # make

  [5. Build Basic Test Code]
  # make -C tests/armv7a/pb-a8/basic

  [6. Launch QEMU 0.14.xx or higher]
  # qemu-system-arm -M realview-pb-a8 -display none -serial stdio -kernel build/tests/armv7a/pb-a8/basic/qemu.img

  [7. Kick Guest for starting Basic Test]
  XVisor# guest kick -1

  [8. Bind to virtual UART]
  XVisor# vserial bind guest0/uart0

  [9. Say 'hi' to Basic Test Code]
  [guest0/uart0] arm-test# hi

  [10. Say 'hello' to Basic Test Code]
  [guest0/uart0] arm-test# hello

  [11. Check various commands of Basic Test Code]
  [guest0/uart0] arm-test# help

  [12. Enter character seqence 'ESCAPE+x+q" return to Xvisor prompt]
  [guest0/uart0] arm-test# 

  (Note: replace all <> brackets based on your workspace)
