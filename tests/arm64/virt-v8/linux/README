		Linux on Xvisor Virt-v8 SMP Guest

Linux is a computer operating system which is based on free and open source 
software. the underlying source code can be used, freely modified, and 
redistributed, both commercially and non-commercially, by anyone under 
licenses such as the GNU General Public License. For more information on 
Linux read the wiki page http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux

Linux already contains a support for device-tree based boards. We can use 
this kernel unmodified to run it as a xvisor guest. We have also provide 
a defconfig for building kernel. To obtain Linux kernel sources visit the 
following url: http://www.kernel.org

Please follow the steps below to build & run Linux kernel with Busybox 
RootFS on Virt-v8 (paravirtualized ARMv8) Guest with Xvisor running on 
Foundation v8 model:

  [1. Build environment for Xvisor]
  # CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu-

  [2. GoTo Xvisor source directory]
  # cd <xvisor_source_directory>

  [3. Configure Xvisor with Generic-V8 default settings]
  # make ARCH=arm generic-v8-defconfig 

  [4. Build Xvisor]
  # make

  [5. Build DTBs]
  # make dtbs

  [6. Build Basic Firmware]
  # make -C tests/arm64/virt-v8/basic

  [7. Copy Linux defconfig to Linux build directory]
  # cp tests/arm64/virt-v8/linux/linux-<linux_version>_virt_v8_defconfig <linux_build_directory>/.config

  [8. GoTo Linux source directory]
  # cd <linux_source_directory>

  [9. Apply patch for virtio-console earlyprintk support]
  # patch -p1 < <xvisor_source_directory>/tests/arm64/virt-v8/linux/linux-3.11-virtio-console-earlyprintk.patch
  (Note: This is an optional but recommended step. Without this earlyprintks will not work on virtio-console)

  [10. Configure Linux in build directory]
  # make O=<linux_build_directory> ARCH=arm64 oldconfig

  [11. Build Linux in build directory to reflect changes in kernel image]
  # make O=<linux_build_directory> ARCH=arm64 Image

  [12. Build virt-v8.dtb for guest linux]
  # <linux_build_directory>/scripts/dtc/dtc -I dts -O dtb -p 0x800 -o <linux_build_directory>/virt-v8.dtb <xvisor_source_directory>/tests/arm64/virt-v8/linux/virt-v8.dts

  [13. Create BusyBox RAMDISK to be used as RootFS for Linux kernel]
  (Note: For subsequent steps, we will assume that your RAMDISK is located at <busybox_rootfs_directory>/rootfs64.img)
  (Note: Please refer tests/arm64/common/busybox/README for creating rootfs64.img using BusyBox)

  [14. GoTo Xvisor source directory]
  # cd <xvisor_source_directory>

  [15. Create disk image for Xvisor]
  # mkdir -p ./build/disk/images/arm64/virt-v8
  # ./build/tools/dtc/dtc -I dts -O dtb -o ./build/disk/images/arm64/virt-v8x2.dtb ./tests/arm64/virt-v8/virt-v8x2.dts
  # cp -f ./build/tests/arm64/virt-v8/basic/firmware.bin ./build/disk/images/arm64/virt-v8/firmware.bin
  # cp -f ./tests/arm64/virt-v8/linux/nor_flash.list ./build/disk/images/arm64/virt-v8/nor_flash.list
  # cp -f ./tests/arm64/virt-v8/linux/cmdlist ./build/disk/images/arm64/virt-v8/cmdlist
  # cp -f <linux_build_directory>/arch/arm/boot/Image ./build/disk/images/arm64/virt-v8/Image
  # cp -f <linux_build_directory>/virt-v8.dtb ./build/disk/images/arm64/virt-v8/virt-v8.dtb
  # cp -f <busybox_rootfs_directory>/rootfs64.img ./build/disk/images/arm64/rootfs64.img
  # genext2fs -B 1024 -b 16384 -d ./build/disk ./build/disk.img

  [16. Create foundation_v8_boot.axf for running it on Foundation v8 Model]
  # ./tools/scripts/memimg.py -a 0x80010000 -o ./build/foundation_v8_boot.img ./build/vmm.bin@0x80010000 ./build/disk.img@0x81000000
  # ${CROSS_COMPILE}gcc -nostdlib -nostdinc -e _start -Wl,-Ttext=0x80000000 -DGENTIMER_FREQ=100000000 -DUART_BASE=0x1c090000 -DGIC_DIST_BASE=0x2c001000 -DGIC_CPU_BASE=0x2c002000 -DSPIN_LOOP_ADDR=0x84000000 -DIMAGE=./build/foundation_v8_boot.img -DDTB=./build/arch/arm/board/generic/dts/foundation-v8/one_guest_virt_v8.dtb ./docs/arm/foundation_v8_boot.S -o ./build/foundation_v8_boot.axf

  [17. Launch Foundation v8 Model]
  # <foundation_v8_install_directory>/models/Linux64_GCC-<xxxx>/Foundation_v8 --image ./build/foundation_v8_boot.axf --network=nat

  [18. Kick Guest0 to start Basic Firmware]
  XVisor# guest kick guest0

  [19. Bind to VirtIO Console]
  XVisor# vserial bind guest0/virtio-con0

  [20. Copy linux from NOR flash to RAM and start linux booting from RAM]
  [guest0/virtio-con0] basic# autoexec
  (Note: "autoexec" is a short-cut command)
  (Note: The <xvisor_source_directory>/tests/arm64/virt-v8/linux/cmdlist file
   which we have added to guest NOR flash contains set of commands for booting
   linux from NOR flash)

  [21. Wait for Linux prompt to come-up and then try out some commands]
  [guest0/virtio-con0] / # ls

  [22. Enter character seqence 'ESCAPE+x+q" return to Xvisor prompt]
  [guest0/virtio-con0] / #

  (Note: replace all <> brackets based on your workspace)
