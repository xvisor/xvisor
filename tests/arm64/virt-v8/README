			Virt-v8 Guest

The Virt-v8 is a fully para-virtualized guest with ARMv8 CPUs.

We only have memory mapped VirtIO devices for IO and this makes the 
Guest as fully para-virtualized. 

The memory map and irqs in Virt-v8 guest is as follows:
0x0000000000000000-0x0000000007FFFFFF (128M)        (NOR Flash)
0x0000000008000000–0x000000000800FFFF (64K)         (GIC Dist Interface)
0x0000000008010000–0x000000000801FFFF (64K)         (GIC CPU Interface)
0x0000000008020000–0x0000000008FFFFFF (16M-128K)    (Reserved)
0x0000000009000000–0x0000000009000FFF (4K) (IRQ=33) (PL011 UART)
0x0000000009001000–0x0000000009FFFFFF (16M-4K)      (Reserved)
0x000000000A000000–0x000000000A000FFF (4K) (IRQ=48) (VirtIO Network Device)
0x000000000A001000–0x000000000A001FFF (4K) (IRQ=49) (VirtIO Block Device)
0x000000000A002000–0x000000000A002FFF (4K) (IRQ=50) (VirtIO Console Device)
0x000000000A003000–0x000000000FFFFFFF (80M-12K)     (Reserved)
0x0000000010000000-0x000000003FFFFFFF (768M)        (Reserved for PCI memory)
0x0000000040000000-0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF (---)         (RAM)

In addition, we also have ARMv8 generic timer accessible to all VCPUs
of the Guest with virtual timer irq 27 and physical timer irq 30.
