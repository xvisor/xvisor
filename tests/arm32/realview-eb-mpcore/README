			Realview-EB-MPCore Guest

This guest has ARM11MPCore (MPCore ARMv6) CPU and various peripherals
expected on a Realview Platform Base Board.

We also have memory mapped VirtIO devices located at unused IO regions 
of the guest for providing VirtIO based paravirtualization.

There are many reserved IO regions as per Realview-EB-MPCore User Guide. From 
these reserved IO regions, we will use the following IO regions for VirtIO:
0x20000000–0x3FFFFFFF (512M) (Reserved)

The VirtIO devices also require a IRQ line per device for functioning. The
Realview-EB-MPCore guest has following unused or reserved IRQ lines:
GIC: 48
GIC: 68
GIC: 69
GIC: 73

The memory map and irq of paravirt devices on Realivew-EB-MPCore guest is
as follows:
0x20000000–0x20000FFF (4K)          (Guest/VM Info Device)
0x20100000–0x20100FFF (4K) (IRQ=48) (VirtIO Network Device)
0x20200000–0x20200FFF (4K) (IRQ=68) (VirtIO Block Device)
0x20300000–0x20300FFF (4K) (IRQ=69) (VirtIO Console Device)
