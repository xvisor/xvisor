		Basic Firmware on VExpress-A9 Guest

The basic firmware currently sets up PIC, Timer, and UART and emulates
a dummy terminal which reponds to various commands. It also includes an
extensive MMU test suite and dhrystone benchmark.

Hardware features tested by Basic Firmware:
  - Sensitive non-priviledged instructions
  - Virtual IRQs
  - Generic Interrupt Controller (GIC)
  - PrimeCell Dual-Mode Timer (SP804)
  - Serial Port (PL011)  

Please follow the steps below to build & run Basic Firmware on VExpress-A9
Guest with Xvisor running on QEMU VExpress-A9 Host:

  [1. Build environment for Xvisor]
  # export CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabi-

  [2. GoTo Xvisor source directory]
  # cd <xvisor_source_directory>

  [3. Configure Xvisor with Generic v7 default settings]
  # make ARCH=arm generic-v7-defconfig

  [4. Build Xvisor]
  # make; make dtbs

  [5. Build Basic Firmware]
  # make -C tests/arm32/vexpress-a9/basic

  [6. Create disk image for Xvisor]
  # mkdir -p ./build/disk/images/arm32/vexpress-a9
  # ./build/tools/dtc/dtc -I dts -O dtb -o ./build/disk/images/arm32/vexpress-a9x2.dtb ./tests/arm32/vexpress-a9/vexpress-a9x2.dts
  # cp -f ./build/tests/arm32/vexpress-a9/basic/firmware.bin.patched ./build/disk/images/arm32/vexpress-a9/firmware.bin
  # cp -f ./tests/arm32/vexpress-a9/basic/nor_flash.list ./build/disk/images/arm32/vexpress-a9/nor_flash.list
  # genext2fs -B 1024 -b 16384 -d ./build/disk ./build/disk.img

  [7. Launch QEMU 1.7.xx or higher]
  # qemu-system-arm -M vexpress-a9 -m 256M -display none -serial stdio -kernel build/vmm.bin -dtb build/arch/arm/board/generic/dts/vexpress/a9/one_guest_vexpress-a9.dtb -initrd build/disk.img

  [8. Kick Guest0 for starting Basic Firmware]
  XVisor# guest kick guest0

  [9. Bind to virtual UART]
  XVisor# vserial bind guest0/uart0

  [10. Say 'hi' to Basic Firmware]
  [guest0/uart0] basic# hi

  [11. Say 'hello' to Basic Firmware]
  [guest0/uart0] basic# hello

  [12. Check various commands of Basic Firmware]
  [guest0/uart0] basic# help

  [13. Enter character seqence 'ESCAPE+x+q" return to Xvisor prompt]
  [guest0/uart0] basic# 

  (Note: replace all <> brackets based on your workspace)
  (Note: the above steps assumes Xvisor running on VExpress-A9 host
   emulated by QEMU. For other types of ARM host some of the above
   steps will need to be adapted for that specfic ARM host. For more
   info on your desired ARM host refer docs/arm/)
