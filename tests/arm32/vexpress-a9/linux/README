		Linux on Xvisor VExpress-A9 SMP Guest

Linux is a computer operating system which is based on free and open source 
software. the underlying source code can be used, freely modified, and 
redistributed, both commercially and non-commercially, by anyone under 
licenses such as the GNU General Public License. For more information on 
Linux read the wiki page http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux

Linux already contains a support for VExpress-A9 Board. We can use 
this kernel unmodified to run it as a xvisor guest. We have also provide 
VExpress-A9 defconfig for various linux kernel versions for ease in 
building kernel. To obtain Linux kernel sources visit the following 
url: http://www.kernel.org

Follow the steps below to build & run Linux kernel with Busybox RootFS on
VExpress-A9 Guest with Xvisor running on QEMU VExpress-A9 Host:

  [1. Build environment for Xvisor]
  # CROSS_COMPILE=arm-unknown-linux-gnueabi-

  [2. GoTo Xvisor source directory]
  # cd <xvisor_source_directory>

  [3. Configure Xvisor with Generic v7 default settings]
  # make ARCH=arm generic-v7-defconfig

  [4. Build Xvisor & DTBs]
  # make; make dtbs

  [5. Build Basic Firmware]
  # make -C tests/arm32/vexpress-a9/basic

  [6. Copy defconfig to Linux build directory]
  # cp tests/arm32/vexpress-a9/linux/linux-<linux_version>_vexpress_a9_defconfig <linux_build_directory>/.config

  [7. GoTo Linux source directory]
  # cd <linux_source_directory>

  [8. Configure Linux in build directory]
  # make O=<linux_build_directory> ARCH=arm oldconfig

  [9. Build Linux in build directory]
  # make O=<linux_build_directory> ARCH=arm Image

  [10. Patch Linux kernel to replace sensitive non-priviledged instructions]
  # <xvisor_source_directory>/arch/arm/cpu/arm32/elf2cpatch.py -f <linux_build_directory>/vmlinux | <xvisor_source_directory>/build/tools/cpatch/cpatch32 <linux_build_directory>/vmlinux 0

  [11. Build Linux in build directory to reflect changes in kernel image]
  # make O=<linux_build_directory> ARCH=arm Image

  [12. Create BusyBox RAMDISK to be used as RootFS for Linux kernel]
  (Note: For subsequent steps, we will assume that your RAMDISK is located at <busybox_rootfs_directory>/rootfs.img)
  (Note: Please refer tests/arm32/common/busybox/README for creating rootfs.img using BusyBox)

  [13. GoTo Xvisor source directory]
  # cd <xvisor_source_directory>

  [14. Create disk image for Xvisor]
  # mkdir -p ./build/disk/images/arm32/vexpress-a9
  # ./build/tools/dtc/dtc -I dts -O dtb -o ./build/disk/images/arm32/vexpress-a9x2.dtb ./tests/arm32/vexpress-a9/vexpress-a9x2.dts
  # cp -f ./build/tests/arm32/vexpress-a9/basic/firmware.bin.patched ./build/disk/images/arm32/vexpress-a9/firmware.bin
  # cp -f ./tests/arm32/vexpress-a9/linux/nor_flash.list ./build/disk/images/arm32/vexpress-a9/nor_flash.list
  # cp -f ./tests/arm32/vexpress-a9/linux/cmdlist ./build/disk/images/arm32/vexpress-a9/cmdlist
  # cp -f <linux_build_directory>/arch/arm/boot/Image ./build/disk/images/arm32/vexpress-a9/Image
  # ./build/tools/dtc/dtc -I dts -O dtb -p 0x800 -o ./build/disk/images/arm32/vexpress-a9/vexpress-v2p-ca9.dtb <linux_source_directory>/arch/arm/boot/dts/vexpress-v2p-ca9.dts
  # cp -f <busybox_rootfs_directory>/rootfs.img ./build/disk/images/arm32/rootfs.img
  # genext2fs -B 1024 -b 16384 -d ./build/disk ./build/disk.img

  [15. Create qemu.img for running it on QEMU]
  # ./tools/scripts/memimg.py -a 0x60010000 -o build/qemu.img build/vmm.bin@0x60010000 build/disk.img@0x61000000

  [16. Launch QEMU 1.7.xx or higher]
  # qemu-system-arm -M vexpress-a9 -m 256M -display none -serial stdio -kernel build/qemu.img -dtb build/arch/arm/board/generic/dts/vexpress/a9/one_guest_vexpress-a9.dtb

  [17. Kick Guest0 for starting Basic Firmware]
  XVisor# guest kick guest0

  [18. Bind to virtual UART0 of Linux Guest]
  XVisor# vserial bind guest0/uart0

  [19. Copy linux from NOR flash to RAM and start linux booting from RAM]
  [guest0/uart0] basic# autoexec
  (Note: "autoexec" is a short-cut command)
  (Note: The <xvisor_source_directory>/tests/arm32/vexpress-a9/linux/cmdlist file
   which we have added to guest NOR flash contains set of commands for booting
   linux from NOR flash)

  [20. Wait for Linux prompt to come-up and then try out some commands]
  [guest0/uart0] / # ls

  [21. Enter character seqence 'ESCAPE+x+q" return to Xvisor prompt]
  [guest0/uart0] / #

  (Note: replace all <> brackets based on your workspace)
  (Note: the above steps assumes Xvisor running on VExpress-A9 host
   emulated by QEMU. For other types of ARM host some of the above
   steps will need to be adapted for that specfic ARM host. For more
   info on your desired ARM host refer docs/arm/)
  (Note: you are free to the change ordering of above steps based on
   your workspace)
