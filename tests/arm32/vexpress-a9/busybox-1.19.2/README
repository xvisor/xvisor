	BusyBox-1.19.2 RootFS for VExpress-A9 Guest

BusyBox provides several stripped-down Unix tools in a single executable. It 
runs in a variety of POSIX environments such as Linux, Android,[6] FreeBSD[7] 
and others, such as proprietary kernels, although many of the tools it provides
are designed to work with interfaces provided by the Linux kernel. It was 
created for embedded operating systems with very limited resources. It is 
released under the terms of the GNU General Public License. For more info

Please follow the steps below to build a RAMDISK using BusyBox-1.19.2, to be
used as RootFS for VExpress-A9 Linux guest:

  [1. Build environment for Xvisor]
  # CROSS_COMPILE=arm-none-linux-gnueabi-

  [2. GoTo Xvisor source directory]
  # cd <xvisor_source_directory>

  [3. Copy defconfig to Busybox-1.19.2 source directory]
  # cp tests/arm32/vexpress-a9/linux-3.0.4/busybox-1.19.2_defconfig <busybox-1.19.2_source_directory>/.config

  [4. GoTo Busybox-1.19.2 source directory]
  # cd <busybox-1.19.2_source_directory>

  [5. Configure Busybox-1.19.2 source]
  # make oldconfig

  [6. Build Busybox-1.19.2 RootFS]
  # make install

  [7. Change ownership of installed RootFS]
  # sudo chown -R root:root ./_install

  [8. Create RootFS image]
  # fakeroot /bin/bash -c "genext2fs -b 3096 -N 1024 -D <xvisor_source_directory>/tests/arm32/vexpress-a9/linux-3.0.4/busybox-1.19.2_dev.txt -d ./_install <busybox_rootfs_directory>/rootfs.img"

  (Note: <busybox_rootfs_directory>/rootfs.img is our final RAMDISK)
  (Note: replace all <> brackets based on your workspace)
  (Note: you are free to the change ordering of above steps based on your workspace)
