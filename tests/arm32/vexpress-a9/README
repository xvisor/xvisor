			VExpress A9 Guest

This guest has Cortex-A9 (MPCore ARMv7) CPU and various peripherals expected 
on a Versatile Platform Base Board.

We also have memory mapped VirtIO devices located at unused IO regions 
of the guest for providing VirtIO based paravirtualization.

There are many reserved IO regions as per CoreTile Express A9x4 reference 
manual. From these reserved IO regions, we will use the following IO regions 
for VirtIO:
0x20000000–0x3FFFFFFF (512M) (Reserved)

The VirtIO devices also require a IRQ line per device for functioning. The
VExpress A9 guest has following unused or reserved IRQ lines:
GIC: 82
GIC: 85-91

The memory map and irq of VirtIO devices on VExpress-A9 guest is as follows:
0x20100000–0x20100FFF (4K) (IRQ=82) (VirtIO Network Device)
0x20200000–0x20200FFF (4K) (IRQ=85) (VirtIO Block Device)
0x20300000–0x20300FFF (4K) (IRQ=86) (VirtIO Console Device)
