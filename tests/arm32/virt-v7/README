			Virt-v7 Guest

The Virt-v7 is a fully para-virtualized guest with Cortex-A15 CPUs.

We only have memory mapped VirtIO devices for IO and this makes the 
Guest as fully para-virtualized. 

The memory map and irqs in Virt-v7 guest is as follows:
0x0000000000000000-0x0000000007FFFFFF (128M)        (NOR Flash)
0x0000000008000000–0x000000000800FFFF (64K)         (GIC Dist Interface)
0x0000000008010000–0x000000000801FFFF (64K)         (GIC CPU Interface)
0x0000000008020000–0x0000000008FFFFFF (16M-128K)    (Reserved)

0x0000000040000000-0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF (---)         (RAM)

In addition, we also have ARMv7 generic timer accessible to all VCPUs
of the Guest with virtual timer irq 27 and physical timer irq 30.
